Minutes of Meeting (MoM)
Project Title:  The SoberFolks -Designated Driver on Demand with Foldable E-Scooters

1. Introduction
This document records the Minutes of Meetings (MoM) conducted for the project “Designated Driver on Demand with Foldable E-Scooters”, which aims to design and develop an innovative application that allows users to book certified drivers on demand who arrive using portable e-scooters. The driver can safely transport the customer’s vehicle to the desired destination, ensuring a convenient, eco-friendly, and responsible transportation experience.
The project integrates real-time location tracking, ride booking and management, AI-assisted features, and driver–customer coordination within a single mobile application developed using React Native, supported by a Node.js backend and MySQL database.
